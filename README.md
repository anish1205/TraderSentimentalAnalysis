# Insights

1. Greed is often linked with trades that were not executed or yielded no profit/loss (PnL = 0):

- Many trades classified as "Greed" fall under the “Trade Not Executed” or zero PnL category.

- This may imply missed opportunities due to overconfidence or hesitation waiting for perfect entries.

2. Fear is predominantly associated with loss-making trades:

- Most negative PnL trades are linked with the “Fear” classification.

- Fear might cause traders to exit prematurely, ignore signals, or act out of panic, leading to losses.

3. Direction affects outcomes:

- There may be a pattern where certain directions (e.g., Sell or Close Short) show more losses when paired with fear, and certain directions (e.g., Buy) show missed profits under greed.

- This can indicate bias towards certain market directions or poor exit strategies.



# How Can a Trader makes his performance bettter? (based on these observations)

1. Create Emotion-Based Rules:

If fear leads to premature exits, introduce rules like:

"Hold until stop-loss or technical signal triggers."

If greed leads to no trades, use structured entry rules:

"Enter when signal is met, even if setup is not perfect."

2. Backtest with Emotion Filters:

Run backtests by excluding trades marked as “fear-based” or “greed-based” to see their historical impact.

This helps in filtering emotionally driven bad trades from the system.

3. Mindset Training:

Incorporate journaling, meditation, or trading psychology books to build resilience.

Understand how your reactions under stress affect performance.

Better Trade Execution Discipline:

Focus on consistency and rule-based trading rather than relying on emotion.

Automate parts of the strategy to reduce discretionary errors caused by emotions.
